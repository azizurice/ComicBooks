In this project, I didn't use any 3rd part library for consuming restful web service like [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), nor did I use any build tools like Maven or Gradle here. There are many 3rd party libraries which make our life easy with little bit effort at the beginning.
But raw solution always good for understanding.

## How will you run this project in eclipse IDE:

2. Import it into Android Studio.Gradle will automatically update the required dependencies.

3. Click on 'Build' >> 'Clean Project' and then Click on 'Run' and 'Run app'.

 You will see a list of comic characters in grid view by default. In case, it is not showing, please click on
    drawer item on grid view. It has also a feature to see the character in list view. In addition, when you click on
   an image, it will show the description in detail view.
